## demo

Annoyingly because of html canvas cross-domain security, you have to run this demo in a server. I use `http-server`, just run it in this directory and visit localhost:8080/

The full source code for this demo is located: [bit-meddler-demo](https://github.com/alanmacleod/bit-meddler-demo)

A live version is running here if you cba to run locally: [demos.alanmacleod.eu](https://demos.alanmacleod.eu/bit-meddler/pub/)
